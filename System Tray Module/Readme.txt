System Tray Example 1.0

This is another System Tray Application.

I know that there are many samples scattered all over Planet-Source-Code but many of them are incomplete or buggy, so I wrote my own.

This code covers the basics of adding an icon right through to the advanced levels such as modifying icons, popup menus, minimising to the tray and using multiple icons, yet is still very easy to follow and is well commented (read the beginning of the module for detaile information).

The code also incorporates a TitleToTray module showing how to animate the mimimizing and restoring of your form to the system tray.

I would also like to thank peoply whos code I have used in this submission, namely Chris Miller for the TitleToTray code which I modified slightly and an unknown author for the basic system tray code (Sorry I don't remember!).

Dispite being a Planet-Source-Code member for so long, this is still oly my first submission to Planet-Source-Code so please vote nicely and leave constructive feedback.

I hope you benefit from this code and if you find any aspect of my code useful, I would appreciate being notified and possibly being included in the credits (you may also want to include the original author of the TitleToTray code (Chris Miller)), but it is not required, at least leave me a comment (and vote!) ;-).

The reason I say this is that I believe that if people freely share this information, and someone else finds it useful, I believe that the original author should be credited. It really disappoints me when people not only use someone elses code without giving credit, but alo try and claim it as their own. This is wrong and selfish, but anyway...

If there are any problems or bugs, feel free to contact me at shaun@visual-source.net, or shaunleeclarke@msn.com if you use the MSN Messenger Service.

Enjoy!
